# The signature of Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs)
# that are formatted in the clausal form (CLF)

# Every clause in CLFs starts with a box variable and an operator.
# The rest of the clause is a sequence of variables where its size depends on the operator

# The signature represented as a set of key-value pairs.
# The KEY is a sequence of letters representing variable types
# and following the variable order in clauses:
#   b stands for a box, x for a discourse referent, t for a term (i.e. a disc. referent or a constant)
# The VALUE is a list of operators whose argument types are described by the KEY

# NB: except the operators in the signature, CLFs also contain wordnet word senses and constants.
# "constants" and "pos.sense_numbers" are in double quotes.
